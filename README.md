Assignment 1:  
  
Library used: OpenTK 4.9.4  
Developed in JetBrains Rider  
Solution should work and open with Visual Studio

Assignment 2:  

Library Used: OpenTK.Mathematics  
Implemented: Addition, subtraction, dot, cross, identity, scaling, rotation, multiplication  
Example output:  
  
  
Vector operations:  
a + b = (5, 7, 9)  
a - b = (-3, -3, -3)  
dot product = 32  
cross product = (-3, 6, -3)   
    
Matrix operations:  
identity = (1, 0, 0, 0)  
(0, 1, 0, 0)  
(0, 0, 1, 0)  
(0, 0, 0, 1)  
result of matrix operations: (1, 0, 0, 1) -> (2, 0, 0, 2)  
  
Quaternion operations:  
original point = (2, 3, 1)  
rotated point  = (0.9999999, 3, -2.0000005)  
  
Process finished with exit code 0.
